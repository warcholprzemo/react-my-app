Tl;dr; it's nothing interesting to read here.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is a frontend for [smupro](https://github.com/warcholprzemo/smupro) with developer settings in ``webpack.config.js``

I don't know why you read it, but really, there is the World outside a window.

Meet friends, go to the gym, smile to stars, eat pizza. Leave this piece of ugly code and enjoy your life!
